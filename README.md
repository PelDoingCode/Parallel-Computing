# Parallel-Computing
I've done some parallel code to study the temporal complexity ! 
To do my code I've used Opem MP and MPI. 

Fisrt a program with MPI in order to compare sequential sorting algorithm to a parallel merge and even&odd sort algortihm, also some beginer program such as Hello_World or SUM to understand Open MP
